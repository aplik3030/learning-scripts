This repo will contain all of scripts, that I've worked on. Some of them were made with some youtube tutorials to practise, some of them are made up by myself. 

Current scripts:
- **backup_test** - simple script to create a compressed backup of specified folder/file.
- **user_management** - powershell script allowing to manage user accounts in Windows

To do:
- Finish backup_test script
- Finish user_management script
- Implement directory organizer script
